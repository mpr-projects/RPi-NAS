# RPi-NAS
This repository contains a few scripts that are used in the Raspberry Pi NAS.

Scripts:
- *__nas_smart_test.py__* is a script intended to be run with cron. It starts a S.M.A.R.T. check of a drive, keeps the drive awake and finally writes the output to one or multiple files. See https://www.mpr-projects/... for details.
